Sometimes you want to play something with a group, but everyone's busy at the moment. RoomBot allows you to create rooms to let everyone know that you're ready to play/do something.

## Features
* RoomBot will automatically disband inactive rooms.
* A colorful hoisted role is assigned to players who join the room, so you know who's in what room.
* A private channel is created for your room.
* Once you have enough people, RoomBot will notify everybody!

### Basic Commands
* `r.new` Create a new room based on your current activity or message
* `r.list` List rooms in current guild.
* `r.join` Join a room with `@someone` or the room name
* `r.leave` Leave a room
* `r.look` Show room information
* ... and more!

## Running Your Own RoomBot
1. Clone this repository.
2. Rename `example.env` to `.env` and update its contents
    * `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is bot token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
      * **!! IMPORTANT !!** Make sure to enable both Privileged Intents under Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents
    * if `ENV` is `development`, then the default prefix will be `t.` instead of `r.`. Use `production` or anything else to have the default prefix `r.`.
3. Install `pipenv`
    * macOS (Terminal) `brew install pipenv` or `pip3 install pipenv`
    * linux (Fedora 28) `sudo dnf install pipenv`
    * windows (Powershell) `pip install pipenv`
4. `pipenv shell`
5. `pipenv install`
6. `python3 index.py`
